## Project Description

This repository is a collection of system-level algorithms that are essential for solving real-world problems. The project includes implementations of:

- Graph traversal algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS)
- Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*)

## Development Story

The journey of developing this project was both challenging and rewarding. It started as a simple exercise to implement basic graph traversal algorithms but quickly evolved into a comprehensive exploration of system-level problem-solving techniques. 

One of the most exciting parts of this project was optimizing the algorithms for performance. For example, implementing Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue significantly improved its efficiency on large graphs.

## Implemented Features

- **Graph Traversal**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Pathfinding**: Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm

---

## Features to Be Implemented
- Visualization tools for better understanding of algorithm behavior
- Integration with real-world datasets for testing
